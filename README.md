# Calculator Project with Tkinter

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Calculator project! This project utilizes Tkinter, a popular GUI library in Python, to create a simple calculator interface. The main focus is on defining a Calculator class, allowing the creation of a calculator object (app), and launching the graphical user interface (GUI) for easy arithmetic operations.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application, creating an instance of the Calculator class and launching the calculator GUI.

## Calculator Class Features

The Calculator class is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations. Key features include:

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear and delete functionality for easy correction.
- A visually appealing interface created using Tkinter widgets.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git
   cd calculator-project
2. Run the application using Python.
    ```bash
    python main.py
3. GUI will appear, allowing you to perform arithmetic operations conveniently.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
